# Gentoo Desktop Installation

I love the flexibility of Gentoo. I have been using this Linux distribution
for more than twenty years, and it is the only one that fully meets my needs.
Yes, it requires some time and patience, but the efforts are well rewarded.

This repository contains the configuration of my Gentoo desktop (Ryzen 5900X,
multilib, PLASMA 6, systemd), in particular my kernel configuration, portage
settings, other modified /etc files, a small local overlay and some scripts
used to simplify system maintenance (see the /root/SYSTEM/BIN folder).

Don't use these files blindly, adapt them to your hardware and needs!
