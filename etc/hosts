192.168.1.80    xpdevplc.home.arpa     # Virtual Machine XP_DEV_PLC_TIAP.

# NOTES
# -----
# According to RFC 1918, you can use the following IP networks for private
# IPv4 nets which will never be connected to the Internet:
#
#       10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255
#       172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255
#       192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255
#
# In case you want to be able to connect directly to the Internet (i.e.
# not behind a NAT, ADSL router, etc...), you need real official assigned
# numbers.  Do not try to invent your own network numbers but instead get
# one from your network provider (if any) or from your regional registry
# (ARIN, APNIC, LACNIC, RIPE NCC, or AfriNIC).
