# Sample configuration file for smartd.  See man smartd.conf.

# Home page is: https://www.smartmontools.org

# smartd will re-read the configuration file if it receives a HUP
# signal

# The file gives a list of devices to monitor using smartd, with one
# device per line. Text after a hash (#) is ignored, and you may use
# spaces and tabs for white space. You may use '\' to continue lines.

# The word DEVICESCAN will cause any remaining lines in this
# configuration file to be ignored: it tells smartd to scan for all
# ATA and SCSI devices.  DEVICESCAN may be followed by any of the
# Directives listed below, which will be applied to all devices that
# are found.  Most users should comment out DEVICESCAN and explicitly
# list the devices that they wish to monitor.
#DEVICESCAN

# Alternative setting to ignore temperature and power-on hours reports
# in syslog.
#DEVICESCAN -I 194 -I 231 -I 9

# Alternative setting to report more useful raw temperature in syslog.
#DEVICESCAN -R 194 -R 231 -I 9

# Alternative setting to report raw temperature changes >= 5 Celsius
# and min/max temperatures.
#DEVICESCAN -I 194 -I 231 -I 9 -W 5

# First ATA/SATA or SCSI/SAS disk.  Monitor all attributes, enable
# automatic online data collection, automatic Attribute autosave, and
# start a short self-test every day between 2-3am, and a long self test
# Saturdays between 3-4am.
#/dev/sda -a -o on -S on -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)

# Monitor SMART status, ATA Error Log, Self-test log, and track
# changes in all attributes except for attribute 194
#/dev/sdb -H -l error -l selftest -t -I 194

# Monitor all attributes except normalized Temperature (usually 194),
# but track Temperature changes >= 4 Celsius, report Temperatures
# >= 45 Celsius and changes in Raw value of Reallocated_Sector_Ct (5).
# Send mail on SMART failures or when Temperature is >= 55 Celsius.

# An ATA disk may appear as a SCSI device to the OS. If a SCSI to
# ATA Translation (SAT) layer is between the OS and the device then
# this can be flagged with the '-d sat' option.

# A very silent check.  Only report SMART health status if it fails
# But send an email in this case

# Monitor 2 disks connected to the first HP SmartArray controller which uses

# by F.C.
#
# Monitor NVMe/SATA storage units; also on SATA units, start a short
# self-test every day between 1-2 AM (if the unit is not in standby).
# On failures, sent a daily mail until the problem is fixed. Old NVMe
# devices (< 1.3) can be only monitored (they do not have SMART tests,
# see https://serverfault.com/questions/1084461/health-tests-on-nvme),
# while NVMes >= 1.3 may have the 'device-self-test' command, that is
# supported by smartmontools >= 7.4; note that selftests are OPTIONAL
# as of NVMe 1.3 specifications (my Sabrent NVMe units have them! :))
# If supported, selftests (short / extended) can also be performed by
# the command 'nvme device-self-test <device> -s 1h' / '2h' (see the
# nvme-* manpage + https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/709259).
#
# NOTE: To have different settings on the SATA disks, we cannot use
# /dev/sdX anymore, because the device names are not more persistent.
# We must use /dev/disk/by-id/ or /dev/disk/by-path instead; for the
# moment I don't require different settings, so I can use /dev/sdX.

# SATA SSD/HDD.
# NOTE: Kingston DC500M SSDs sometimes need a reboot/power cycle to
# show the test as completed (stay stucked at 00% until the reboot).
