Kernel system variables configuration files.

Files found under "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory (that end with .conf) are parsed
by sysctl(8) at boot time.  If you want to set kernel variables you can either
edit "/etc/sysctl.d/99-override.conf" or make a new file here (don't make it a
package name, as it may clash with something the package builder creates later).
The file name must end with ".conf", or it will not be parsed. The naming and
source directory decide the order of processing, which is important since the
last parameter processed may override earlier ones. The command (from root):

    sysctl --system 2>/dev/null | grep --color=never "sysctl"

will show the order in which sysctl's configuration files are parsed. See the
sysctl.conf(5) man page for details about the format of configuration files.


NOTE: Configuration file "/etc/sysctl.conf" has been deprecated for some time,
      and recently removed in Gentoo (and other Linux distributions).

NOTE: System defaults (i.e. sysctl configuration of packages) have been moved
      to "/usr/lib/sysctl.d/"; some packages might still use "/etc/sysctl.d/".

NOTE: DO NOT ASSUME THAT FILES IN "/etc/sysctl.d/" ARE PARSED AFTER FILES IN
      "/usr/lib/sysctl.d/"; use the above command to find-out the order.
