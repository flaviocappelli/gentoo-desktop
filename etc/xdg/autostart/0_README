# Processes in this directory are automatically started when a user enter an X session
# unless:
#
#  - the corresponding .desktop file has a 'Hidden=true' key;
#  - the current DE (desktop environment) match a DE listed in 'NotShowIn' key;
#  - the current DE (desktop environment) does not match a DE listed in 'OnlyShowIn' key;
#  - the value of 'TryExec' key (if exists) does NOT match an installed executable.
#
# An individual user can override the automatic start by placing, in its personal autostart
# directory (.config/autostart) a desktop file of the same name, with the key 'Hidden=true'.
#
# NOTE the 'NoDisplay=true' key does not prevent the process to start (it simply tells the DE
# to not show such process within the "started application page" of the DE control application).
#
# NOTE also the exec bit does not affect the behaviour of such desktop files!
