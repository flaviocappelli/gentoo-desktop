# Kernel options for Gentoo on Cerberus:
#
# * On Gentoo, 'systemd' already uses the unified (i.e. modern, also named v2) cgroup
#   interface (if USE flag 'cgroup-hybrid' is not set): we don't need to force it here.
#
# * There are eight kernel log levels; all kernel messages < 'loglevel' will be printed
#   to the console (see the manpage for the 'dmesg' command). A good level is '3', which
#   only prints critical conditions or worse situations; higher values pollutes the boot
#   screen so should be avoided unless required; to view everything set 'loglevel' to 8.
#
# * Grub make available two set of options for the Linux kernel:
#    - GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX:          options that are always effective
#    - GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT:  options effective ONLY during normal boot
#                                   (i.e. NOT during the recovery mode).
#
# * Default keyboard layout is set:
#    - here for grub;
#    - in /etc/vconsole.conf for virtual consoles (not X);
#    - in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf for X (but DEs can override it).
#
# * Option 'amd_pstate=<mode>' enable the AMD P-State driver (kernel >= 6.6 LTS is
#   required). Delete such option if you want to go back to the acpi-cpufreq driver.
#   I prefer to start the driver in passive mode (with schedutil as default governor)
#   and let the TLP service set the P-State mode, governor and energy policy, for AC and
#   BAT (the latter only makes sense on laptops, it can be safely ignored on desktops).
