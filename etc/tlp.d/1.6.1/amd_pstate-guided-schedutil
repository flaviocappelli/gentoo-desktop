##
## Use 'tlp-stat -c' to show the active TLP configuration.
## Use 'tlp-stat -w' to show warnings related with power management.
## Use 'tlp-stat -p' to show the active driver and available governors.


## Ensure TLP is enabled.
TLP_ENABLE=1

## Operation mode when no power supply can be detected.
TLP_DEFAULT_MODE=AC

## AMD P-STATE SCALING DRIVER - CPPC auto/enabled in BIOS - KERNEL >= 6.6 LTS
## CPPC = [auto] works on the 'MSI B550 Gamin Plus' + Ryzen 5900X, but some systems wants CPPC = [enabled].
## To enable the AMD P-State driver, add 'amd_pstate=<mode>' option to the kernel command line (see below)
##
## Driver operating mode: passive (since kernel 5.17) -> amd_pstate      (best default (boot) <mode>)
##                        active  (since kernel 6.3)  -> amd_pstate_epp  (better to set it using TLP)
##                        guided  (since kernel 6.4)  -> amd_pstate      (better to set it using TLP)

## This file tells TLP to use the 'guided' mode on AC and the 'active' mode on BAT
## (see below). Indeed on BAT, the 'active' mode + 'powersave' governor might be the
## best (but some people prefere the 'passive' mode + 'conservative' governor).
CPU_DRIVER_OPMODE_ON_AC=guided
CPU_DRIVER_OPMODE_ON_BAT=active

## Scaling governors in active mode: performance, powersave (*).
## Scaling governors in passive/guided mode: conservative, ondemand (*), userspace, powersave, performance, schedutil (*).
## NOTE: governors marked with (*) are power efficient for **ALMOST ALL** workloads.
CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=schedutil
CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=powersave

## CPU energy/performance policies (active mode only, ignored on others):
## performance, balance_performance, default, balance_power, power.
#CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_AC=balance_performance
CPU_ENERGY_PERF_POLICY_ON_BAT=balance_power

## Allows to raise the maximum frequency/P-state of some cores if the
## CPU chip is not fully utilized and below it's intended thermal budget
## (note that a value of 1 does *not* activate boosting, it just allows it).
## It has effect on almost 'guided' and 'active' modes (passive not tested).
CPU_BOOST_ON_AC=1
CPU_BOOST_ON_BAT=0

## Improve performance by increasing minimum P-state limit dynamically
## whenever a task previously waiting on I/O is selected to run. Only for
## Intel CPU >= Skylake, with intel_pstate scaling driver in active mode.
#CPU_HWP_DYN_BOOST_ON_AC=1
#CPU_HWP_DYN_BOOST_ON_BAT=0

## Define disk devices on which the following DISK/AHCI_RUNTIME parameters act.
DISK_DEVICES="nvme0n1 nvme1n1 sda sdb sdc sdd sde"

## Disk advanced power management level: 1..254, 255 (max saving, min, off).
## Levels 1..127 may spin down the disk; 'keep' keeps the disk hardware default.
DISK_APM_LEVEL_ON_AC="254 254 254 254 254 254 254"
DISK_APM_LEVEL_ON_BAT="128 128 128 128 128 128 128"

## Select I/O scheduler for the disk devices. Currently disabled,
## because determined by /etc/udev/rules.d/60-my-schedulers.rules
#DISK_IOSCHED="mq-deadline mq-deadline mq-deadline mq-deadline mq-deadline mq-deadline mq-deadline"

## AHCI link power management (ALPM) for SATA disks. Allowed values: min_power,
## med_power_with_dipm, medium_power, max_performance. Restore the TLP-1.5 defaults
## (multiple values separated with spaces are tried sequentially until success).
SATA_LINKPWR_ON_AC="med_power_with_dipm max_performance"
SATA_LINKPWR_ON_BAT="med_power_with_dipm min_power"

## Settings for RADEON driver only: dynamic power management
## method (DPM). Allowed values: balanced, battery, performance.
## NOTE: the AMDGPU driver has already the recommended settings.
RADEON_DPM_STATE_ON_AC=performance
RADEON_DPM_STATE_ON_BAT=balanced

## Audio power saving for Intel HDA, AC97 devices (0 disabled, > 0 timeout sec).
## See Manjaro forum, stable update 2021-10-16.
#SOUND_POWER_SAVE_ON_AC=0
#SOUND_POWER_SAVE_ON_BAT=0

## Do not disable the audio controller too (HDA only).
#SOUND_POWER_SAVE_CONTROLLER=N

## Disable the USB autosuspend feature. NOTE: There is no real
## need to disable the USB autosuspend globally; it's better to
## create appropriate udev rules for problematic devices, see:
## https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/ls15yw/
## https://hamwaves.com/usb.autosuspend/en/
#USB_AUTOSUSPEND=0

## Do not disable Wake-on-LAN (by default is disabled).
#WOL_DISABLE=N
