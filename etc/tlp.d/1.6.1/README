Don't use such config files blindly: perform some tests to determine
which mode, governor and energy policy (when allowed) works best for
your system, in both AC/BAT profiles. Try different workloads, like:

 - idle state
 - kernel build
 - internet browsing
 - video and audio transcoding
 - gaming and 3D engine benchmarks
 - filesystem operations on big files
 - compress of big archives

Generally you should consider:

 - on AC : which configuration provides the best performance while
   limiting the generated heat and fan(s) noise to acceptable levels;

 - on BAT : which configuration provides acceptable performance while
   maximizing the battery life.

On a desktop system (i.e. always AC powered) you can safely ignore the
BAT profile (it is not used if the host is always AC powered). Also you
can enable one configuration that maximize performances (at the expense
of more heat and consumed energy) but compared to other setups the gain
might be minimal (and might not be worth it). Whatever setup you choose,
make sure the desktop is enough cooled, otherwise the CPU will reach its
thermal limits, resulting in slowdowns and (maybe) physical damage.

On my desktop system, the driver 'amd-pstate-epp' seems to delivers the
best performance-per-Watt (with the 'balance_performance' energy policy).
