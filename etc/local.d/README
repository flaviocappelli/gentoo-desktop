This directory contains programs or scripts which are to be run
when the local service is started or stopped.

If a file in this directory is executable and it has a '.start'
extension, it will be run when the local service is started. If
a file is executable and it has a '.stop' extension, it will be
run when the local service is stopped.

NOTE: all files in this directory are processed in lexical order
and sequentially; moreover, the local service is not considered
started or stopped until everything is processed, so if we have
a process which takes a long time to run, it can delay our boot
or shutdown processing.

On Gentoo with systemd, this directory is parsed by script
/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/gentoo-local-generator
(from package 'sys-apps/gentoo-systemd-integration').
