Pulseaudio is gone, the place to put pulseaudio related
options would be '/usr/share/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf'
after copying it to '/etc/pipewire/' (note that by default
'/etc/pipewire/' might not exist).

The only file that should exist here is 'client.conf',
with active option 'autospawn = no' (emerge default).
