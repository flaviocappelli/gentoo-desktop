# === ENABLED EBUILDS (FROM INSTALLED OVERLAYS) ==========================

# HDD and SSD benchmark tool with a very friendly graphical user interface
# (similar to CrystalDiskMark in Windows). It uses 'sys-block/fio' (for the
# exact tests launched see https://github.com/JonMagon/KDiskMark/issues/130).
# Note that benchmarks on ZFS are currently not accurate, due to multiple
# cache levels (see https://github.com/JonMagon/KDiskMark/issues/148).
