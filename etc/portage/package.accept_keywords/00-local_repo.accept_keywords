# Ryzen 5000 (Zen3) advanced termal sensor and monitoring (emerge
# zenmonitor3) + NCT6687-R Super I/O for MSI B550 Gaming Plus. Note:
# the 'zenpower3' module is abandoned but it still works with kernel
# 6.6 LTS and works with the KDE/PLASMA System Monitor plasmoid (while
# 'k10temp' that now is compatible with Ryzen 5000, does not, at leat
# up to PLASMA 6.0.3, see https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=X, with
# X = 438318, 474766, 484019 and 490675). NOTE: the 'k10temp' module
# must be blacklisted (see /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf).

# Some tools for FPGA development. The ebuilds of Icarus Verilog, Verilator,
# Yosys, iCEstorm, PrjTrellis, Apicula, and NextPNR have been removed due to
# the high maintenance and testing workload. These tools are interrelated, and
# sometimes issues arise when updated individually. Instead, the OSS-CAD-SUITE
# environment (https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build) is recommended:
# it offers a comprehensive all-in-one solution that works seamlessly on Gentoo
# (as well as on other Linux x86_64/Arm64 distributions, MacOS, and Windows)
# and we can even have multiple versions of the OSS-CAD-SUITE installed.
