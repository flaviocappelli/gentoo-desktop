#   https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OpenCL#AMD

#
# -------- OpenCL ONLY --------
# emerge -pv clinfo
#
# 1) USE=opencl emerge media-libs/mesa
#    MESA >= 23.1.0 uses "rusticl" instead of "glover". Note that "rusticl" is still experimental
#    (and incomplete, see https://mesamatrix.net/) and the radeonsi implementation must be enabled
#    with the environment variable RUSTICL_ENABLE=radeonsi (see https://docs.mesa3d.org/envvars.html).
#    Also note that mesa[opencl] cannot be installed together with ROCM (dev-libs/rocm-opencl-runtime).
#
#    TESTS:  darktable works
#            luxmark-3.1 luxball with -cl-fast-relaxed-math enabled/disable: score around 60650..60850
#            luxmark-4.0-alpha1 (not updated since 2020!) default scene: hangs compiling OpenCL kernels
#
# 2) emerge dev-libs/amdgpu-pro-opencl
#    cannot be installed together with media-libs/mesa[opencl]
#    old, not maintained, deprecated in favor of ROCM (dev-libs/rocm-opencl-runtime)
#
#    TESTS:  untested
#
# -------- OpenCL + ROCM + HIP --------
# ROCM is a mess, only a small number of video cards are officially supported by AMD.
# Also, on Gentoo, some packages sometimes do not build, while others build but do
# not work, so we have to try different versions to see wich works on our system.
#
# emerge -pv rocm-opencl-runtime clinfo rocminfo
# emerge -pv dev-util/hip hipBLAS hipFFT hipCUB hipRAND ... (see below)
#
# NOTES:
#  * ROCM cannot be installed together with mesa[opencl]
#  * ROCM DOCS are available at 'https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/xxxYYYY/en/latest/' for
#    package 'xxxYYYY' (e.g. rocBLAS -> https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocBLAS/en/latest/)
#
# MY TESTS FOR "dev-libs/rocm-opencl-runtime" WITH THE GPU "AMD Radeon RX 6900XT":
#  * 5.5.1     ->  luxmark-3.1 works, darktable-4.8 cltest works
#  * 5.7.1-r1  ->  luxmark-3.1 CRASHES, darktable-4.8 cltest works
#  * 6.1.1     ->  NOT TESTED
#  * 6.1.2     ->  NOT TESTED RECENTLY (previously worked)
#  * 6.1.2-r1  ->  luxmark-3.1 works, darktable-4.4 cltest works, fix a segfault (see Gentoo changelog)
#  * 6.2.4     ->  MASKED IN PORTAGE
#
# It seems that ROC OpenCL version 5.7 has poor performances compared to 5.5, at least on Fedora. See:
# https://community.amd.com/t5/discussions/issue-with-poor-integer-performance-rocm-opencl-5-7-1/m-p/646380
#
# NOTE: with ROCM OpenCL runtime 0/5.5 we can emerge the 0/5.7 slot for all other ROCM components; instead,
# the 0/6.1 runtime needs the 0/6.1 slot for all other ROCM components (aside rocm_bandwidth_test, see below).
