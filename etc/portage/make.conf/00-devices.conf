# If not set, VIDEO_CARDS defaults to: 'amdgpu dummy fbdev intel nouveau radeon radeonsi vesa'.
# Flag i915 is required only for Intel GPU Gen 2 and Gen 3 (should not be used in Gen >= 4), see
# https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Intel; some flags have been removed from portage (all valid video
# card flags are listed in https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/video_cards_vesa), while other
# flags are related to very old GPU's hardware (r100, r128, r200, r300, r600, via) or ARM GPUs.

# NOTE: Mesa-25.2.x drops the Gallium-XA state tracker (used to accelerate X11 within the VMware
# virtualized environments, see https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-Stop-Building-XA); for the time
# being, the flag "vmware" in VIDEO_CARDS pull in "x11-drivers/xf86-video-vmware" that requires the
# (dropped) 'xa' flag in mesa, raising conflicts; so we must drop "vmware" from VIDEO_CARDS (such
# flag is not required for the VMSVGA driver in virtualBox, see https://bugs.gentoo.org/957955).
