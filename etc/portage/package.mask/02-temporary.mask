# These are temporary fix (will be removed in the future).

# SMplayer < 23.12.0 does not work with MPV >= 0.37: the 'SPACE
# KEY' stops the video but does not resume it (instead, it works
# with MPV 0.36, that has been removed from portage). But version
# 26.12.0 and above (not in portage, see my local repo) fixes that
# and also fixes the subtitle download failure (that was due to new
# OpenSubtitle's APIs, see https://www.smplayer.info/en/changes).
