# These are temporary fix (will be removed in the future).

# SMplayer < 23.12.0 does not work with MPV >= 0.37: the 'SPACE
# KEY' stops the video but does not resume it (instead, it works
# with MPV 0.36, that has been removed from portage). Versions
# 26.12.0 and above fixes that, and also fixes the subtitle
# download failure (that was caused by new OpenSubtitle's
# APIs, see https://www.smplayer.info/en/changes).

# Mask Python-3.13 until truly required.
