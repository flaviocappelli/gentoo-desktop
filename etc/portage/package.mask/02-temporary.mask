# SMplayer < 23.12.0 does not work with MPV >= 0.37: the 'SPACE
# KEY' stops the video but does not resume it (instead, it works
# with MPV 0.36, that has been removed from portage). Versions
# 26.12.0 and above fixes that, and also fixes the subtitle
# download failure (that was caused by new OpenSubtitle's
# APIs, see https://www.smplayer.info/en/changes).

# With systemd-256.x I can no longer login to my user managed by
# systemd-homed! (known issue, see https://bugs.gentoo.org/937941).
# Systemd-255.x works fine, so I will delay the update of systemd
# until the Gentoo developers will decide what to do to fix it.
