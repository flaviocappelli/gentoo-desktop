# VirtualBox is making me crazy: branch 7.1 still has issues
# (see https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=110513,
# https://www.reddit.com/r/Gentoo/comments/1ifh71j/ and also
# https://bugs.gentoo.org/941622). Indeed, I tried v7.1.8 on
# my Gentoo desktop and it did end up with "NS_ERROR_FAILURE".
# So I can't upgrade. Meanwhile, even branch 7.0 added issues:
# latest STABLE ebuild (7.0.26-r1) has removed the GUI because
# based on Qt5, due to Qt5 going away from Gentoo (see Gentoo
# bug #948836). THIS IS MADNESS: many packages still need Qt5!
# At the moment, the only possibility is to mask all upgrades.
# VirtualBox 7.0.22 works very well, but it has been removed
# from portage so I had to copy it into my overlay!
