# There is a fork (https://github.com/vitlav/hddtemp) that does it, but no
# ebuilds are yet provided. Anyway, today, it is better to use the sensors
# command (with -j option and a little bit of postprocessing), or get the
# temperatures directly from /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon* (readable by normal
# users), see: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/558112.
