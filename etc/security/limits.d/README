All *.conf files in this folder (plus '/etc/security/limits.conf', if exists)
allow setting resource limits for users logged-in via PAM. This is a good way
of preventing fork-bombs from consuming all system resources. All configurable
limits are described in '/etc/security/limits.conf' and limits.conf(5) manpage
(see also https://serverfault.com/questions/773609).

Please note that, if the above files are changed, the new resource limits will
take effect only after a reboot. Current resource limits can be observed with:

 - ulimit -aS  ->  soft limits                (bash internal command)
 - ulimit -aH  ->  hard limits                (bash internal command)
 - prlimit     ->  both soft and hard limits  (util-linux >= 2.21)

Also, 'ulimit' and 'prlimit' allow us to set limits on the fly (but new limits
will not be persistent, they'll survive only until the next reboot). Note that
unlike ulimit, prlimit allows us to specify a PID in addition to the resource
type (see https://www.baeldung.com/linux/prlimit and prlimit(1) man page).


** WARNING **
Resource limits set with the above files will take effect or not, depending on
the use of the 'pam_limits.so' module in /etc/pam.d/*; therefore, the (default)
behavior will strongly depend on the Unix-like used distribution! Moreover, in
systemd based OS, we must also consider the resource limits imposed by systemd
system/user configuration files (and services file, where such limits can be
locally overridden). The behavior may vary with the distribution used.


** GENTOO BEHAVIOR **
Above resource limits are applied to processes started after the login (both
GUI / NON-GUI), but they WILL NOT AFFECT SYSTEMD SERVICES, NOR OPENRC SERVICES
STARTED AT BOOT. Systemd services have limits set by '/etc/systemd/system.conf',
'/etc/systemd/user.conf' and other *.conf files in several subdirs (when exist,
see systemd-system.conf(5) man page). OpenRC services started by hand after the
login will obey the above limits; services started at boot can obey limits set
in /etc/conf.d/* (https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1095304-start-0.html).
NOTE: OTHER LINUX DISTROS MAY BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY FOR GUI AND NON-GUI LOGINS!


** IMPORTANT NOTE **
MANY PARAMETERS IN "PAM LIMITS" ARE EXPRESSED IN KB (FEW IN BLOCKS OR BYTES),
WHILE THE EQUIVALENT PARAMS IN SYSTEMD CONFIGURATION FILES (AND SERVICES FILE)
ARE EXPRESSED IN BYTES (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/345595/).
INCORRECT PARAMETERS MAY PREVENT THE OS FROM COMPLETING THE BOOT PROCESS, SO
BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN ASSIGN SUCH LIMITS IN SYSTEMD CONFIGURATION FILES!
