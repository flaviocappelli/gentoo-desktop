# configuration. Parallel requests will be sent to per-link DNS servers
# configured automatically by systemd-networkd.service(8), NetworkManager(8), or
# similar management services, or configured manually via resolvectl(1). See
# resolved.conf(5) and systemd-resolved(8) for more details.

# DNSoverTLS (DoT) needs that the router the and root servers support it; also we
# must open ports TCP/853 (TSL) and TCP/443 (HTTPS) on the local (and any remote)
# firewalls. As alternative we can enable DNSoverTSL transparently on OpenWRT (in
# this case clients do not need changes, they can still perform plain DNS queries).
#
# NOTE: enabling DNSoverTLS on the clients, might require systemd 250.5 (or above);
# it's not clear if the required patches are backported in systemd 249.11 maintained
# by Ubuntu, so at the moment the transparently DNSoverTLS on the router is better.

#   https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/dns/stubby
#
# A better alternative is DNSoverHTTPS (DoH) but is not yet implemented in systemd.
# It requires only ports TCP/443 (so practically it cannot be blocked by ISP or by
# policies established by the company's IT department, and ensure a better privacy
# as the DNS requests are hidden in HTTPS traffic). Package net-dns/dnscrypt-proxy
# can act as DoH proxy, DNS cache and system resolver.
