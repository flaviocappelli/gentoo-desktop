Historically all libvirt functionality was provided in the
monolithic 'libvirtd' daemon. Since libvirt-9.3.0 there is
a new modular architecture for libvirt, where each driver
(QEMU, LXC, ...) is run in its own daemon, see:

  https://libvirt.org/daemons.html#modular-driver-daemons

The monolitic daemon is still supported, so the switch to
the modular architecture is currently not required (but it
will be in the future).

Note that the modular daemons have their own configuration
files. The instructions for the switching, provided in the
Gentoo wiki (i.e. https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Libvirt) are
inaccurate! Please refer to the following link:
