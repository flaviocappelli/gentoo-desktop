## Overridden configs for Gentoo Distribution Kernels.


## NOTES
## -----
## Comments must begin with ##.
##
## A CONFIG_XXX item is disabled with '# CONFIG_XXX is not set'
##
## (*) SDDM ebuild suggest to enable it or install sys-apps/haveged
## (or sys-apps/rng-tools). But such tools are not required anymore
## (indeed all kernels >= 5.6 have the haveged algorithm built in).
##
## The sys-apps/irqbalance daemon is not required anymore because
## now the Linux kernel is capable of balancing irqs by itself (it
## is even counter-productive, especially for low latency audio).
