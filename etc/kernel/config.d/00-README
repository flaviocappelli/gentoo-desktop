## Override configuration of Gentoo Distribution Kernels.
## This setup is intended for desktops/gaming/low latency audio,
## while still supporting a wide range of hardware and features.

## NOTES
## -----
## Comments must begin with ##.
##
## Items can be disabled with '# CONFIG_* is not set'
## or with 'CONFIG_*=n' (but the former is preferred).
##
## All kernels >= 5.6 have an HAVEGED inspired algorithm built-in
## so, despite what is stated in the SDDM Gentoo ebuild, packages
## sys-apps/haveged and sys-apps/rng-tools are not longer required
## (see the README in https://github.com/jirka-h/haveged).
##
## sys-apps/irqbalance is also no longer required (it might be even
## counter-productive, especially for desktops / gaming / low latency
## audio) because Linux is now able to balance the irqs by itself (see
## https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-meta/+bug/1833322).
